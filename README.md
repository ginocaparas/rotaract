This is just a working prototype of the Rotaract - Rotary Philippines website. Created using HTML5. 

Initial hi-fidelity prototypes created via Adobe XD. Published here (along with a prototype of the main Rotary Philippines site) :

- Rotaract Mobile Flow: https://xd.adobe.com/view/c894e5db-4de1-4145-876a-74964270cea7-9dc7/

# Features
- Horizontal scrolling! 
    - I wanted to make the website feel like you're scrolling through the pages of a magazine. This also works on mobile.
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Adjustable font sizes - requested by my boomer bosses haha

# Translating to Wordpress

Once the final designs have been tested and approved by stakeholders, I created a Wordpress theme for use in https://rotaract.rotaryphilippines.com. This is still in use as of 2023 and is updated regularly.
